### Install docker

If you have a Debian-Based Operating System you can use the docker.io package.
```console
apt install docker.io
```

> If you are using a docker supported OS that does not have the docker.io package, you should take a look at [this page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

You can also use the docker install script by running:
```console
curl https://get.docker.com | sh
```
